# Vulnerability Scanner Simulator

## Overview

The Vulnerability Scanner Simulator is a simple web application designed to simulate the process of scanning a system for vulnerabilities. This tool allows users to select different types of scans, such as port scanning, service detection, and vulnerability assessment, and provides simulated results with recommendations for mitigating potential security issues. 

## Features

- **Port Scanning:** Simulate a scan for open ports on a system.
- **Service Detection:** Identify and list services running on different ports, including potential security risks.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Perform a simulated scan for known vulnerabilities and receive a list of detected issues.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** View results directly on the web interface, with clear and concise output.
- **Educational Tool:** Includes simulated outputs that are useful for learning about different types of scans and common vulnerabilities.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the page layout.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the interface, including buttons, text, and the results area.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for simulating scans and displaying the results.
